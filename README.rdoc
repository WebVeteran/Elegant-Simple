== Elegant Simple

This message style is a working proof of concept, a custom scrollbar in Adium. 
It is a prototype for the talented folks that create our wonderful message styles. 
I hope that others will use it as a spring board for rapid development of a whole new breed of message styles with custom scrollbars.

See /media folder for screen shots and video.
